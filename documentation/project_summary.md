**Project Codename** : CrawlReady
**Target Launch** : Q1 2026
**Indie Hacker Side Hustle Approach**

This document outlines the complete brand positioning and 18-month technical roadmap for an AI
Crawler Optimization SaaS targeting JavaScript-heavy websites that are invisible to AI search engines
like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude.

**Market Opportunity** : Only 31% of AI crawlers support JavaScript rendering. With 98.9% of websites
using JavaScript, this creates a massive gap. Prerender.io (the market leader) generates <$5M with
600K domains served—representing just 1.2-3% market penetration.

**Your Advantage** : AI-first positioning with unique features (citation tracking, schema injection) that
competitors don't offer.

**FOR** : JavaScript-heavy SaaS companies, e-commerce stores, and content publishers

**WHO** : are losing visibility in AI search (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude) because only 31% of AI crawlers
can properly render their JavaScript content

**CrawlReady IS** : A developer-friendly rendering service that ensures your content appears correctly in
ChatGPT Search, Perplexity, Claude, and other AI answer engines

**THAT** : Automatically detects AI crawlers, renders your JavaScript in <200ms, and serves optimized
HTML with AI-friendly markup—all while providing real-time analytics on which AI platforms are citing
your content

**UNLIKE** : Prerender.io (focused on traditional Google SEO) or DIY Puppeteer solutions (time-
consuming maintenance)

**WE** : Specialize exclusively in AI crawler optimization with features like citation tracking across LLMs,
automatic schema injection for answer engines, and predictive AI crawler analytics

## Technology Stack

## Frontend

```
Next.js 14 (App Router) - Best DX, Vercel deploy
TypeScript - Type safety
TailwindCSS - Fast styling
shadcn/ui - Component library
Recharts - Data visualization
```
## Backend

```
Node.js + Express - API server
PostgreSQL (Supabase) - Database
Drizzle ORM - Type-safe ORM
Redis (Upstash) - Cache layer
BullMQ - Job queue
```
## Rendering

```
Puppeteer - Chrome automation
@sparticuz/chromium - Lambda-compatible Chrome
Puppeteer Cluster - Parallel rendering
```

Detects 15+ AI crawlers including:

## Infrastructure

```
Vercel - Frontend hosting
Railway/Fly.io - Render workers
CloudFlare CDN - Cached HTML delivery
Supabase - Database + Storage
```
## Monitoring

```
Sentry - Error tracking
Axiom - Log management
PostHog - Product analytics
Stripe Dashboard - Revenue metrics
```
## Key Architecture Components

## 1. Crawler Detection Module

```
GPTBot (OpenAI)
OAI-SearchBot (ChatGPT Search)
ChatGPT-User (real-time queries)
ClaudeBot (Anthropic)
PerplexityBot (Perplexity)
Google-Extended (Gemini)
```
## 2. Rendering Engine

```
Headless Chrome via Puppeteer
Parallel rendering with Puppeteer Cluster
Resource optimization (block unnecessary assets)
Configurable wait times and timeouts
Auto-scroll for lazy-loaded content
```
## 3. Cache Layer

```
Redis for in-memory caching
CloudFlare CDN for global distribution
Configurable TTL (6-48 hours based on plan)
Cache invalidation API
```

Auto-detects and injects:

**Risk** : Rendering engine fails on complex JavaScript apps
**Mitigation** : Extensive testing framework, public test suite, automated visual regression testing

**Risk** : Infrastructure costs explode at scale
**Mitigation** : Intelligent caching, spot instances, optimize Chrome efficiency, tiered infrastructure

**Risk** : Prerender.io lowers prices or acquires you
**Mitigation** : Differentiate on features (citation tracking), build community moat, focus on underserved
segments

**Risk** : Google/platforms build native solutions
**Mitigation** : Platform-agnostic positioning, focus on multi-crawler optimization, build deep integrations

**Risk** : Market adoption slower than projected
**Mitigation** : Start with vertical (e-commerce), offer free tier, aggressive content marketing, focus on
ROI metrics

```
Cache hit rate optimization
```
