## Brand Story

### Origin Story

**The Problem We Discovered:**
In late 2024, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Search, giving 200M+ users direct access to AI-powered search. But we noticed something: modern JavaScript websites were invisible to AI crawlers. While Google had spent years improving JavaScript rendering, AI companies were starting from scratch—and most couldn't render JavaScript at all.

**The Insight:**
We realized this wasn't just an SEO problem—it was an entirely new category. Companies were losing visibility in the fastest-growing search channel (400% YoY growth) because their React/Vue/Angular sites returned blank pages to AI crawlers.

**The Solution:**
We built CrawlReady specifically for AI search engines. Not as an SEO tool that happens to work for AI, but as an AI-first platform with features like citation tracking, LLM-optimized schemas, and real-time AI crawler analytics—things traditional SEO tools don't offer.

**The Mission:**
Help every JavaScript-heavy business succeed in the AI search era without requiring expensive rebuilds or months of engineering work.
